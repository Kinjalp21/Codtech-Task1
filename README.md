**Name:** KINJAL HASMUKH PANCHAL </br>
**Intern ID:** CT08EJB </br>
**Internship Domain:** React.js Web Development </br>
**Internship Duration:** December 17th, 2024 - January 17th, 2025 </br>

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a simple and interactive to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app enables users to add, edit, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes the ability to filter tasks based on their completion status. This project helps in understanding key React concepts such as state management, event handling, and component-based architecture, along with basic styling using CSS.

## Features:
**1. Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks with a title and description.\
**2. Edit Tasks:** Users can edit the details (title and description) of existing tasks.\
**3. Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from both the "To-Do" and "Completed" lists.\
**4. Mark Tasks as Complete:** Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually distinguishes them from pending tasks.\
**5. Filter Tasks:** Users can filter tasks by their status, showing "All Tasks", only active "To-Do" tasks, or only "Completed" tasks.\
**6. Local Storage Integration:** Tasks are stored in local storage, allowing data persistence even after a page refresh.

## Technology Used:
**1. Frontend:** React.js\
**2. CSS:** Custom CSS for styling the application\
**3. Storage:** Local Storage\
**4. Tools used:** VS Code

## Project implementation Steps:
**1. Planning & Setup:** Break the app into components (Task List, Input, Filters) and set up state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) to handle tasks, completed tasks, and filtering.\
**2. Develop Features:** Implement the functionality for task creation, editing, deletion, completion, and filtering.\
**3. Styling:** Apply basic CSS for a clean, responsive layout, ensuring that the user interface is responsive and visually appealing.\
**4. Testing & Deployment:** Test app functionality to ensure that the state management and local storage work seamlessly and that tasks persist even after page refreshes. The app can be deployed using platforms like Vercel or Netlify for live use.
